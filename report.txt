merge:
This creates a new “merge commit” in the feature branch that ties together the histories of both branches

rebase:
This moves the entire feature branch to begin on the tip of the main branch, effectively incorporating all of the new commits in main. But, instead of using a merge commit, rebasing re-writes the project history by creating brand new commits for each commit in the original branch.
